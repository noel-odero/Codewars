I'm your host, Apex Rhombus, and it's time for the lightning round!</p><p>Today we'll talk about a hypothetical bottle. This entire bottle weighs 120 grams. Its contents weigh twice as much as the bottle itself. What, may I ask, do the contents weigh?</p><p>...Did you guess 80 grams? Correct! Now that you've got that idea, I'm gonna ask you that question in many different ways so you'd better get ready!</p><hr><p>Let's complete the function that takes in two parameters: <code>bottle weight</code> and <code>scale</code>. This function will return the weight of the contents inside the bottle.</p><ul><li><p><code>bottle weight</code> will be an integer representing the weight of the entire bottle (contents included).</p></li><li><p><code>scale</code> will be a string that you will need to parse. It will tell you how the content weight compares to the weight of the bottle by itself. <code>2 times larger</code>, <code>6 times larger</code>, and <code>15 times smaller</code> would all be valid strings (smaller and larger are the only comparison words).</p></li></ul><p>It is guaranteed that the result will always be an integer. Good luck!</p>
