This is a sadly story #1: Are they opposite?</a></h2><h3>8 kyu</h3><h2 id="task">Task</h2><p>Give you two strings: <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code>. If they are opposite, return <code>true</code>; otherwise, return <code>false</code>. Note: The result should be a boolean value, instead of a string.</p><p>The <code>opposite</code> means: All letters of the two strings are the same, but the case is opposite. you can assume that the string only contains letters or it's a empty string.  Also take note of the edge case - if both strings are empty then you should return <code>false</code>/<code>False</code>.</p><h2 id="examples-input---output">Examples (input -&gt; output)</h2><pre><code>"ab","AB"     -&gt; true"aB","Ab"     -&gt; true"aBcd","AbCD" -&gt; true"AB","Ab"     -&gt; false"",""         -&gt; false</code></pre>
